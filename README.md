# hello-world
A project for learning the basics of GitHub through the classical "Hello world!" example.

My name is Aidan Calderhead, but I also respond to my nickname 'Gonzo.'
My favorite color is blue, and I remember the day I realized that was when I was five and saw that the "good" jedis from Star Wars typically had blue lightsabers.
Fun fact: I'M USING CAPS LOCKS RIGHT NOW TO SAY THAT MY BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP ON SEPT. 27TH!!
